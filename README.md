# Simplex-Search-Direct-Download-Everything-Via-Google-Queries
 Simplex provides a very capable file indexing and search service allowing you to find a file among huge no.of files located under open directories of web servers.It only provide access to already available files in a same way Google do but in a formalized easy query search.

<b>Movies/Tv Series/Videos</b></br>
intitle:"index.of" (mp4|avi|mkv) "name or title" -html -htm -php -asp -jsp</br>

<b>Music</b></br>
intitle:"index.of" (mp3|flac|aac) "name or title" -html -htm -php -asp -jsp</br>

<b>e-Books/Docs</b></br>
intitle:"index.of" (pdf|epub|mob) "name or title" -html -htm -php -asp -jsp</br>

The bit in parenthesis states the filetypes you are looking for, next in quotes is the content/keywords you are looking for, next with minus signs are things that you do not want to see. The first bit - intitle:"index.of" is to get you open directories specifically of various active web servers. Any text that is specific to open directories would work. For example;

"parent directory" "name or title" (.mp4|.mkv|.avi|.wmv|.mov) -html -htm -php -asp -cgi

The wriiten php content fundamentally adds these inquiries auto to your question and hunt the substance through open directories through Google Query Engine.
